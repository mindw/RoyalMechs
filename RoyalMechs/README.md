# RoyalMechs Battetech Mod
Additional Royal variants following patterned after the variants
introduced in 1.9.1. Should work with both ModTek and vanilla mod loader.

These are _not_ available in shops - as the prices are not updated.
Instead, use [FellOfACargoShip] or [BattleTech Save Editor] mods to add them 
your mech bay.
